# What is nextjs and what is the difference with React

It's a react framework for building web apps

react is a library for building UIs, responsible for the view layer only of the app.
we need to use others libs for routing, data fetching and more.

But nextjs is react FRAMEWORK, it uses react for building UI's but offers additional features like 
routing, optimized rendering, data fetching, compiling, bundling and more.
no need to install addition packages like in react.

thus enabling the build of a production ready apps.


# Nextjs features that simplifie the process of building apps with:

- **Routing**: built in, no need to install routing packages, configure them and write code for them.
- **API routes**: create apis, makes it fullstack framework. write frontend code for react and apis that are called byt react app.
- **Rendering**: supports both client side and server side rendering, which results in better performance and SEO.
- **Data fetching**: simplified data fetching wih async await support.
- **dev and prod build system**: allow to focus on coding rather than configuration.
- **Styling**: supports css modules, css in js and tawilwindcss.
- **Optimization**: out of the box for images font and scripts to improve app core web vitals and UX.
